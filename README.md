Help wanted with issues tagged `help_wanted`

## WebAssebly
- Some of this will eventually be written in WebAssembly 
- This will improve performance **A LOT** (I hope...)
- That would allow bigger world sizes which then allows me to test/experiment with world generation on a larger scale which would mean adding trees & that stuff
- repo where I try to get WebAssembly stuff to work: [MarcellPerger1/wasm_stuff](https://github.com/MarcellPerger1/wasm_stuff)

## NOTES:
- The added current unix time after .json and .png fetches (`?t=...`) to bypass the cache as replit cache doesn't update when file is modified by a script (stupid replit)
